technical challenge made using create-react-app

# How to run the project
```npm install```

then 

```npm start```

# Some points to highlight
- With more time I would include unit/integration test (I could do TDD but what a matter of time)
- I would refine a little bit some areas like API service to actually get the JSON file trough a fetch call, "store" naming comes from vue and probable redux/reducers would be more apropiated, also I would do a proper css reset on global styles intead of just apply some rules to *. 
- I was tempted to use a domain to have all the games logic inside but I wasn't sure about how it will grow and I rethink it
- I write SaSS code and use a plugin to transpile it to CSS avoiding to configure it on webpack
- I started to do some styling but I didn't complete it cause of time
